# hello-world
I am preparing to dive deep into Java. But first, I'm getting to know GitHub. Hello GitHub world!

Sometime before becoming a developer tools evangelist, I wrote code on a network operating system. But I discovered that programming at a desk in an office all day every day was very different from my experience in graduate school. I didn't like the difference. I missed talking to people! Becoming an evangelist allowed me to spend more time talking to people while still being involved in the technology that I loved.

Looking back on it now, I'm shocked to also realize that nothing I did in my professional programming came close to the technical challenges I had enjoyed at school. My challenges in my programming work were all ... cultural.

So, I'm back and I want it all! I going all the way in with Java and learning more than I need to show other developers how an IDE works. Let's see what comes.
